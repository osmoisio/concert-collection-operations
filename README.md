We define class Concert and following operators for the class:
* == and != that compare the concert title and location
* < and > so that concert is smaller if the price is smaller
* ++ and -- to increase or decrease the concert price by 5 units

We initialize an arraylist with five Concert objects and use the > operator to put the objects in ascending order based on their price. We use the rest of the defined operators to make sure they work correctly.
